##  EDA & Visualization

- Distribution of Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score
- Gender-based analysis using KDE and boxplots
- Pairplots to understand feature relationships

---

##  Clustering (KMeans)

- Applied KMeans clustering on selected features
- Used Elbow Method to determine optimal number of clusters
- Visualized cluster groups using scatter plots

---

##  Results & Findings

- Customers were segmented based on income and spending behavior
- Identified distinct groups:
  - High income, low spending (potentially underserved)
  - Low income, high spending (loyal but price sensitive)
- Visualizations showed patterns useful for targeted campaigns

---
